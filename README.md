# BTTAI-Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a variety of AI and machine learning projects developed as part of the Breakthrough Tech AI program in 2024-2025. Each project demonstrates different aspects of AI, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Below is a brief overview of each file included in this repository.

### 1. `Pickle_Airbnb_Classification_Model.pkl`

- **Description:** A pre-trained classification model for predicting whether an Airbnb host is a superhost by analyzing data of numerous of Airbnb listings, stored in a Pickle file format.
- **Contents:** Training, testing, and evaluating a Logistic Regression Model, performing Logistic Regression Model Selection Using GridSearchSV()

### 2. `PredictingLogGDPPerCapita.ipynb`

- **Description:** A Jupyter Notebook that outlines the process of predicting the logarithm of GDP per capita using various machine learning techniques.
- **Contents:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, training, testing, and evaluating a linear model, improving a linear model using the SGD model, bagging, stacking, and cross-validation.

### 3. `airbnbListingsData.csv`

- **Description:** A CSV file containing data on Airbnb listings, used for training and evaluating the Airbnb classification model.


### 4. `WHR2018Chapter2OnlineData.csv`

- **Description:** A CSV file containing data from the World Happiness Report, used for training and evaluating the Predicting Log GDP Per Capita model.
